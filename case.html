					<p>The project required the development and implementation of a blast monitoring system to monitor seismic vibrations in a railway tunnel caused by detonation of blasts in a mining operation. The objectives were to develop a data-capture system that could be interfaced to a small laptop PC. Each channel could be configured to trigger data capture or just record data. Digital filtering examined the captured data and presented real time information. The benefit of this system was that it could be left in the tunnel and had a minimum of 16 channels connected to accelerometers and other measurement devices. The triggering of the data capture could be set for any channel with a suitably attached and calibrated sensor. The arrays of accelerometers were fixed to the tunnel walls at strategic positions and measured the P and S wave energy resulting from the operational blasts. The aim was to provide a tool that allowed the operator to ensure their blast design remained within prescribed environmental limits. The system screens immediately showed the blast data and could be recorded for compliance or later review. This system could also be used for environmentally sensitive locations where the public or stake holders need to monitor sites that mat be damaged by ground vibrations.</p>

					<p>The objective of this project was to investigate the feasibility of developing a magnetic sonde that utilises very low frequency magnetic fields to measure differential settlement in real time. A working prototype was developed and tested and sonde measurement data was compared to known laboratory data. The system was tested in a several field environments to study signal propagation through solid rock and fill materials. A working “stand alone” prototype system that can be placed in a real environment and monitor differential settlement was successfully developed.</p>
					<p>A literature search has was conducted to identify theory and practice. The initial relationships between magnetic field, distance and angle were established. A method of signal analysis for accurate detection of the sonde signal using Dazylab was developed and a set of calibration data was acquired for use with the sonde to determine distance.</p>
					<p>Field trials were performed at a local metal mine and potash mine to study the effect of solid rock on propagation of the transmitted signal. The trials were successful.</p>
