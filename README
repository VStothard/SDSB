This project is a copy of the original SDS website, which has now been rebuilt on the Bootstrap framework.

The site has been designed and developed for Simulation Design Services, and is continually being improved to ensure optimum cross browser support, and responsive design across viewing devices. 

Given the high rate of IE usage within the industry, the structure of the site has been developed to cater for its inconsistencies (for example, lack of support for the <button> tag), and will be continually improved over time.
