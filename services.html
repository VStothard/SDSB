            <h2>3D Modelling and Animation</h2>
            <p>Computer based 3D modelling and animation of industrial processes is commonplace nowadays. Industrial design processes generate volumes of 3D models and drawings that can be leveraged to produce 3D visualisations or virtual reality and augmented reality environments. In their simplest form, manufacturer models can be optimised and placed in 3D rendering software or modern game engines for display. These models can be ‘cartoon’ like or high resolution renders delivered via video renders similar to those used in the film or advertising industries.</p>
            <p>At Simulation Design Services, we can develop 3D models of industrial processes, equipment manufacture or site operations and transfer them into video renders or stills that can be used for training inductions, promotions, sales and so-on.</p>
            <p>3D models can also be placed into modern game engine platform and used as interactive demonstrations via mobile devices such as phones and laptops.  They can also be raised to the next level and combined with learning outcomes to provide engaging and interactive training simulations or serious games.</p>

            <h2>Alternative Technology Visualisation</h2>
            <p>Virtual reality simulation and visualisation is a powerful medium to demonstrate alternative technology concepts to clients. 3D models are easier to modify than physical mock-ups and prototype and potential clients can see ideas and concepts in context. The scalability of virtual reality technology hardware, from handheld mobile devices, all the way up to large scale immersive visualisation facilities allows clients to be engaged with the new concept and the direct relevance of new technology to their sites can be visualised via 3D virtual reality or augmented reality applications.</p>

              <p>Simulation Design Services provide consulting and technical services to clients. Through our knowledge and experience, we are able to research technology options that will provide the best solution for your organisation. We achieve this via an Industry Needs Analysis, Feasibility, or more detailed Scoping Study. This approach forms the foundation of the visualisation and simulator acquisition process.</p>
              <p>Generally, the first stage is to analyse or identify the issue that must be addressed within the organisation. Once this framework is in position, the numerous ‘offering’ from consultant, solution providers, technology developers and so-on can be research and evaluated logically and against the selection criteria identified in the initial review.</p>
              <p>Once these processes are complete, the various technologies or solutions that may fit the organisations needs can be evaluated further and if need be several technologies may be brought together to develop a unique solution. Once the final framework is established, the system can be planned, refined, and integrated into the organisation via a formal plan that provides a sustainable pathway towards implementation of visualisation and simulation technologies into routine operational activities. Simulation Design Services also works with technology providers to realise visualisation technologies ranging from small handheld devices up to large screen immersive environments.</p>
              <p>Example industry reports and analyses are available in the <a href="publications.html">Portfolio</a> section of this site.</p>

            <p>The project required the development and implementation of a blast monitoring system to monitor seismic vibrations in a railway tunnel caused by detonation of blasts in a mining operation. The objectives were to develop a data-capture system that could be interfaced to a small laptop PC. Each channel could be configured to trigger data capture or just record data. Digital filtering examined the captured data and presented real time information. The benefit of this system was that it could be left in the tunnel and had a minimum of 16 channels connected to accelerometers and other measurement devices. The triggering of the data capture could be set for any channel with a suitably attached and calibrated sensor. The arrays of accelerometers were fixed to the tunnel walls at strategic positions and measured the P and S wave energy resulting from the operational blasts. The aim was to provide a tool that allowed the operator to ensure their blast design remained within prescribed environmental limits. The system screens immediately showed the blast data and could be recorded for compliance or later review. This system could also be used for environmentally sensitive locations where the public or stake holders need to monitor sites that mat be damaged by ground vibrations.</p>

            <p>The objective of this project was to investigate the feasibility of developing a magnetic sonde that utilises very low frequency magnetic fields to measure differential settlement in real time. A working prototype was developed and tested and sonde measurement data was compared to known laboratory data. The system was tested in a several field environments to study signal propagation through solid rock and fill materials. A working “stand alone” prototype system that can be placed in a real environment and monitor differential settlement was successfully developed.</p>
            <p>A literature search has was conducted to identify theory and practice. The initial relationships between magnetic field, distance and angle were established. A method of signal analysis for accurate detection of the sonde signal using Dazylab was developed and a set of calibration data was acquired for use with the sonde to determine distance.</p>
            <p>Field trials were performed at a local metal mine and potash mine to study the effect of solid rock on propagation of the transmitted signal. The trials were successful.</p>

            <h2>Environmental Impact Visualisations</h2>
            <p>Visualisation and augmented reality provide a method for the visualisation of environmental and social impacts of proposed developments. Existing landscapes can be photographed or modelled to present a 3D environment, and then computer generated models and data can be superimposed upon those images. The impact of proposed activities or developments can be demonstrated to stakeholders in context and the benefits of the new development or its impacts can be modelled studied and refined to provide an environmental solution that addresses the concerns of all. Environmental visualisations can be presented on mobile devices, presented in board room or community forums or can be modelled on powerful visualisation systems that can demonstrate the more long term environmental impacts via computer simulation of real processes.</p>

            <p>Safety on construction, mining or any work site is paramount. Virtual reality and augmented reality simulation provides an opportunity for people to be trained in a safe and forgiving environment. Modern design processes develop complex 3D models and data management systems that can be brought together for many purposed. The first is training and risk management evaluation. That is, the proposed work site can be evaluated for potential risks inherent in the design and through collaboration between team members, risk and hazards can be removed or reduced to a minimum and robust safe work procedures developed to manage such hazards. Also, virtual reality and augmented reality can be used to develop a Mining Information Modelling (MIM) system that records processes and as built detail throughout the project life cycle. Past present and future data can be modelled and short, medium and long term strategic business decisions can be improved via improved knowledge and modelling.</p>

              <p>Modern GIS systems and mine planning software can be expensive for individual consultants or small companies to run and maintain. Modern virtual reality simulations engines and 3D modelling software can provide a lower cost alternative and allow detailed 3D models to be built quickly and effectively. For example, if your company has a lot of drill core that needs to be logged or re-evaluated, it can be costly to access all the core and re-map it. Placing such core in a virtual reality or augmented reality simulation provides an efficient tool that can be used to engage many stakeholders with the core via the integration of 3D and 2D images of core, combined with core logs, assay data and 3D models of ore boundaries and structural feature. Past geological models can be superimposed and new an old ideas compared to develop an up to date and realist virtual model that can be used for targeted exploration and re-evaluation.  The method can also be used for re-evaluation of tailing dams via the combination of campaign data, geophysical data and geochemical data to produce a 3D model that can be used to identify unprocessed mineralogy. The system can also be used to develop case studies for various orebody extraction methods and types.</p>
